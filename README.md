# Recursion-Practice
 This repo contains my learning journey of recursion in Java.
 
 📌1. What you learned today
 
 # Recursion Practice 🔁

Today I learned about recursion in Java.

## Key Concepts:
- ✅ Base Case
- 🔁 Recursive Case
- 🙏 Faith Step (trusting recursion to work for smaller inputs)

📌 2. What problems you solved

## Problems Practiced
- Factorial
- Fibonacci
- Sum of array
- Power of a number
📌 3. Code Explanation

## How Factorial Works
- If n == 0 or 1 → return 1
- Else → n * factorial(n-1)
📌 4. Future Plans
  
## Next Steps 🚀
- Practice backtracking
- Write dry run notes
- Solve 10 more recursion problems
